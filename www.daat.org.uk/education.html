Supporting education and training in Africa</h1>
<hr  width="354" />
<h2 align="center">Education and Training in Africa</h2>
Many African Countries spend a high proportion of their budgets on education. 
However, whilst access to primary and secondary education has seen great improvements in recent years, economic pressures mean that opportunities for specialised training are severely restricted.
<br />
<br />
At DAAT, we believe that increased access to higher-level education and training is vital to enable African people to bring about fundamental socio-economic change in their own countries. 
Investing in education and training helps to open up employment and income generation opportunities and to improve standards of living. 
In particular, education and training are essential components in the development of effective organisation and administrative structures.
<a name="de"></a> <h3 align="center">Distance Education</h3>
Traditional forms of education require high-cost resources - buildings, teaching staff and so on. Distance education is a highly flexible form of education which uses a variety of different media such as printed self-study texts, audio and video cassettes and does not rely on the costly infrastructure of conventional education. 
It can therefore provide a cost-effective means of education and training. 
Distance education also enables people to train on-the-job, allowing them to combine study with home and work commitments.<br />
<br />DAAT takes a particular interest in sponsoring students taking courses by <a href="distancelearning.html">distance learning</a>.
